Iâ€™ve always been the type of guy that wants to know how things work and why they work the way do, from cars to software I am interested at the deepest level on how things tick and thats probably why I am so interested in web development. Some things I love are tea, code ( of course ), cars or really anything with an engine that revs high and goes fast.</p>
